# Website
The Air website, located at [http://airphp.org](http://airphp.org).

## Quick start guide
You can get the Air website up and running through Docker in five easy steps:

1. Clone the repository into a local directory.
2. Run `composer install`.
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`.
4. In your hosts file, point `airphp.org` to the IP address of your Docker instance.
5. Visit http://airphp.org and it will now be pointing to your local project.

Please note that for the above to work you will need [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/docker-compose) already setup.
